### **Introduction**

**Problems**

Linear Algebra is one of those subjects that's required knowledge for many technical discipline (e.g Computer Science, Physis, Electrical Enginnering, Machanical Engineering, Statistics). But it generally poorly understood by students taking it for the first time. A student might might go through a class and learn how to compute lots of things like matrix multiplication, determinant, cross products, or eigenvalues. But they might come out without really understannding why matrix multiplication is defined the away that it is, why the cross product has anything to do with the determinant, or what an eigenvalue really represents. !!

**Geometric and Numberic Understanding**

Often times, students end up well-practiced in the numerical operations of matrices, but are only vaguely aware of the geometric intuitions underlying it all. But there's a fundamental difference between understanding linear algebra on a numerical level and understanding it on a geometric level.

Each approach has its place, but (roughly speaking) the geometric understanding is that let's you judge what tools to use to solve specific problems, feel why they work, and know how to interpret the results. The numberic understanding is what lets you actually carry through the application of those tools.
