Expectation $$==$$ arithmetic mean.
**Expectation** is the **arithmetic mean** of RV (random variable), that coming from any probability distribution.

A **probability distribution** defines the relative frequency of outcomes of a RV

The **expected value**:  (can be thought) as a weighted average of those outcomes. (**weighted by the relative frequency**)

~ EV can be thought as the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers drawed/generated in exact proportion to their probability of occurring.
