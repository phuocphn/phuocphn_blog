<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

There are a lot of platforms out there to help you, but each of them are catered for different types of category and customer. Understanding each pros and cons of populator payment gateway can help you to decide which one is the most suitable for your ecommerce store.

In this post, I will only focus on the payment gateways that can easily integrated with Shopify stores.  I will also give some recommendations about which payment gateways should be for easy registration and  also account stability.

#### **The Needs for Payment Gateway**
Choosing the best payment gateway for the platform becomes vital that *ensures a personalized experience for customers* and also *increases the conversion rate*.


#### **What Is A Payment Gateway ?**
**From the view of a customer:**
Imagine you come across an ecommerce store and want to buy something from it. You add the product to your cart and navigate to checkout. In the backend, a online payment gateway is needed for this transaction. Basically, it will receive the details of your credit card, then deduct the amount spent and sent it to the store's owner account after including some fees.

**Formal definition:**
A payment gateway refers to software/platform that securely interfaces between an eCommerce website and a customer’s preferred mode of payment, which can be their bank account, credit card, debit card, gift card, or any online wallet.

There are some payment gateways that you may know about such as  Braintree, PayU, Amazon Payments, Stripe, PayPal, Skrill. With the help of an online payment gateway provider, it becomes easy to accept and process several types of electronic payments. Instead of setting up and running all the software, hardware, connections, and security, online payment gateway services offer a complete all-in-one solution.


#### **How do eCommerce Payment Gateways work?**
There are two broad categories to know when selecting your payment gateway: integrated  (redirect customers to the payment platform’s processor to finish their online purchases) versus hosted payment gateways (allow you to connect your website through the payment gateway’s API and your customer does not leave your domain.). Redirecting to a third-party platform is a notorious disruption of sales, so that’s something to consider when selecting a payment gateway. Remember that, all payment gateways are PCI compliant, meaning that they meet specific security standards as they collect sensitive information like credit card numbers and addresses. 

**Payment Workflow**

1. Customers start the checkout process on your eCommerce or dropship store, after filling our their credit card information, the gateway sends encoded transaction data to the payment processor of the seller’s bank. 
2. The payment processor then sends that data to the associated credit card, and the credit card’s bank approves or denies the transaction request. 
3. The processor delivers the approval back to the gateway, and then the payment gateway successfully and securely processes said payment. 
4. Finally, the pending purchase clears as soon as the seller fulfills the customer’s order, and the seller’s bank can receive the payment from the customer’s bank.

#### **Criteria for Choosing a Payment Gateway for Dropshippers**
Not all payment gateways are suitable for dropshipping. And you should consider different factors to decide whether which one is appropriate for your objectives. Let’s suppose you have established your ecommerce dropshipping store and are now looking for a payment gateway. Here is the criteria that you need to follow:

- Does it support dropshipping? (this information can be easy found in their website homepage.)
- Select a payment gateway that is popular in the country where you are targeting your products.
- What are the transaction fees? & Ensure the online payment gateway offers a low transaction fee.
- Check if it is compatible with dropshipping stores. Most ecommerce gateways don’t prefer dropshippers because of higher refund rates.
- Check if you can use the gateway, once you plan on expanding in the global market
- Check if it offers a good shopping experience to the customers, make customers feel safe and secure (usually it involves wheater the checkout page is customizable or not)
- Choose an Appropriate Payment Flow (whether it is an embedded frame on the website or it needs to redirect to another for payments, easy to integrate to require more additional programming skills..)
- Choosing the Correct Product (different payment gateways have a list of prohibited items that are not allowed to sell, please carefully check this before making final decisions)
- Make Checkout Easy on All Devices  & Support Mobile Payment (it is powered by payment gateway but is optimized for mobile devices, and it will replace credit card buying)
- Easy Integration Process
- 24×7 Customer Support (For your own peace of mind, it’s better to pick a payment gateway with excellent customer service, because you want to work with the people / services if you have any chargebacks, or other issues )

**Note**:  These two gateways offer multiple merchant accounts for redundancy and backup. But for registration, it requires the history transaction of your store. Therefore, it is recommended that you should use Paypal and Stripe first, and then come back to it later.


**My advice for new starters.**
Chargebacks are a frequent occurrence for businesses in high-risk industries and Payment Gateway usually want to avoid working with such businesses.  that. Even if you store are not selling such high-risk products,  but somehome the number of chargebacks are exceed the allowed threshold, your store can be affected. What happened to a lots of people is that they don't think it'll ever happen to them, but when it does it shuts your entire business down. You should never have one of anything ever. You always should have a backup for critical pieces of your business, and especially, Payment processing. 

> You need to setup correctly before it happens.

#### **Some Frequently Asked Questions**:

Q: Can I start using a payment gateway before registering my company? [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-start-using-a-payment-gateway-before-registering-my-company)

A: Yes, it's possible, but without business documents, you won't be able to withdraw money.


#### **Conclusion** 
Choosing a payment gateway for your business can be quite difficult. There are quite a few things to pay attention to and each payment gateway has its pros and cons.

If you are just starting your business, I recommend you to not pay too much attention to pricing. The most important factor is that your customers will be able to pay in their preferred payment method. This will cause you to get extra sales, which will compensate for extra transaction fees.

You should find out which countries you would like to sell to and what the most popular payment methods in those countries are. Then, I would recommend picking the most popular payment methods like Shopify Payments and Paypal.
